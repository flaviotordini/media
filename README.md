# Qt Media Library Abstraction

This is a simple wrapper around a multimedia playback library.

Define `MEDIA_QTAV` to link to QtAV or `MEDIA_MPV` to link to libmpv (>=0.29.0).

`MEDIA_AUDIOONLY` can be defined if the application does not need video.

You can use this library under the GPLv3 license. If you do, you're welcome contributing your changes and fixes.

If you would like to use this library in a commercial project, contact me at flavio.tordini@gmail.com
